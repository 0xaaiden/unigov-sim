## **Unigov-Sim: Proposal Simulation Tool**


**Unigov-Sim** is a one-stop app to simulate the outcomes of proposals before submitting them to Governor Bravo implementation. We provide a smooth interface, along with automated ABI parsing for target contracts and type checking for functions supported.

### **Quick Start**
Requirements:

- Node 18+ (
  [install nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) and then run `nvm use --lts` to uprade to node 18.)
- Npm 8+

```bash
npx create unigov-sim@latest
```

To get started, utilize this quick one-liner setup:

<!-- Reqs make sure node 18+ is installed, nvm use --lts to install node 18 -->


Follow the intuitive steps to add your API keys and Governance contract address to get started.
